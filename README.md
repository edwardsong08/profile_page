  About Me: 
  Before software development, I've had the opportunity to explore many of my interests which include an educational background in engineering and political science and a professional background in education, writing, and law.

  Teaching has always been a rewarding experience, and watching my students grow continues to inspire me. So, I will forever remain a teacher and a student- nurturing to others and unafraid to ask questions. The challenges 
  I have faced in law have taught me that a methodical approach will always yield a solution. So, I will apply this to every challenge that comes my way. Through writing comedy, I discovered that there are always new, valid perspectives. 
  So, I will remain vigilantly open-minded. Ultimately, these are the principals by which I live and approach software development.

  I am passionate about political, educational, and judicial reforms. My free time is spent hiking with my dog, tampering as an amateur guitar luthier, reading, or exploring new foods in the area.
